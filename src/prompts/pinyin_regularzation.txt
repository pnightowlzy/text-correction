Given a list of the top N-best text outputs and N-best Pinyin transcriptions
from a Chinese Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system, your task is to use
your language understanding capabilities to correct potential errors. Analyze
the text and Pinyin, identify discrepancies, and provide the most accurate and
contextually appropriate correction. Consider factors like homophones, tonal
variations, and context to ensure the corrected output accurately represents
the intended message.

N-best text outputs:
{{nbest}}

N-best Pinyin transcriptions:
{{nbest_pinyin}}

Please output the corrected text directly without any explanation. Remember not
to change the number of characters in the corrected text. If you are not
confident in the correction, please select the best option from the N-best list.
If you are confident in the correction, please provide the corrected text
directly.

The output should be in the following JSON format:
{"text": "your corrected text"}
